# Apocalypse-2D-game-and-genAI-exploration
This is a game I created on PixelPAD.io in Python using my programming experience. The main goal of this project is to explore the potential of generative AI in game design. The design aspects are primarily made by prompting ChatGPT. However, the coding is primarily human, and I found that ChatGPT struggles to produce code for less-popular game engines like PixelPAD because it doesn't fully understand their documentation.

Before you play:
- Use w,a,s,d, or arrow keys to move
- Tap or hold the space bar to shoot
- If you die, refresh the page from the browser to restart the game
- You can check out the code by scrolling down and clicking [See inside]
- Good luck!

More details:

Coding:
- I am a code coach and I teach making games using Python on Pixelpad
- I decided to make a project over multiple days to create my own game
- I learned a lot of new concepts, like the math equations necessary to calculate
  the angle between the player and the enemy, so that the enemy can move towards the player
- When I didn't know how to code something, I would primarily resort to Pixelpad's documentation because I found it challenging for generative AI to help with coding in the context of PixelPAD. Even though the language is in Python.

Game Design:

As I mentioned, this project aimed to explore the limits of generative AI and simplify the software development experience for those passionate about development and creation. 

  AI-generated assets:
  - main room
  - door
  - gun
  - game cover photo

  Pixelpad assets:
  - player
  - enemy
  - bullet/laser
  - gunshot sounds

  Free assets on Google:
  - win screen
  - lose screen

The main wow factor for me was that I was able to produce a fully functional game without having to create any of the assets myself and without having to pay for them.

Generative AI:
- used ChatGPT Pro primarily to generate images
- All other free AI versions, like Deep AI, proved to be not as effective with image generation
- Used AI for coding and debugging assistance
- proved to be not as effective with coding as it did not understand PixelPAD's documentation that well
