# Apocalypse-2D-game
This is a game I have made on PixelPAD.io using my programming experience. This game also allowed me further to explore generative AI in the context of game design. 

Before you play:
- Use w,a,s,d, or arrow keys to move
- Tap or hold the space bar to shoot
- If you die, refresh the page from the browser to restart the game
- Good luck!
